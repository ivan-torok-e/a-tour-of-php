    // Numbers can come in two main type
    // one is the Integer based
    //   * these are numbers that can be either positive or negative value
    //   * has no precision, which means it can't represent fractions
    // PHP is lazy by terms of types
    // If not enforced by syntax the original default is something like duck typing
    //   * if it's sounds, moves, behaves and interacted with as a Duck, than it's a duck
    //
    // An integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
    // Rules for integers:
    //   * An integer must have at least one digit
    //   * An integer must not have a decimal point
    //   * An integer can be either positive or negative
    //   * Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10-based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)
    //
    // A float (floating point number) is a number with a decimal point or a number in exponential form.
    //
    // Examples:
    //   1 + 1 == 2
    //   1 + 2 == 3
    //   1 / 2 == 0.5 # Beware!!! This is usually 0 in other languages, because types usually don't change with simple operators like "/"
    //   1 - 2 == -1
    //   1.0
    //   2.5
